"Don't be a dick" license.

Any content in this repository should be assumed to be freely available, for any
purpose, with or without attribution at any time. It is recommended that if the
usage is cool or provides some monetary benefit that I be credited, and maybe
compensated in some way that seems fair, but it is not necessary and agreement
to this license should not be construed as a contractual obligation to do so.

I reserve the right to change this license at any point, in which case the
amended license will apply to all iterations of the content that exists in this
repository from that point forward. I also reserve the right to call you a dick
if you egregiously violate the spirit of this license, even if you don't violate
it to the letter.
