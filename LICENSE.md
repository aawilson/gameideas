"Don't be a dick" license.

Any content in this repository should be assumed to be freely available, for any purpose, with or without attribution at any time. It is recommended that if the usage is cool or provides some monetary benefit that I be credited, and maybe compensated in some way that seems fair, but it is not necessary and agreement to this license should not be construed as a contractual obligation to do so.

I reserve the right to change this license at any point, in which case the amended license will apply to all iterations of the content that exists in this repository from that point forward. I also reserve the right to call you a dick if you egregiously violate the spirit of this license, even if you don't violate it to the letter.
